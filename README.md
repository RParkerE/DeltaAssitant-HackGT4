# Getting Started

[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) is a framework which allows one to develop native phone applications 
using web app design (TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3) which is then compiled and built for the specified platform.
You will need to install both Node.JS and Ionic in order for this application to work.

# This Repository

This repository is only the src file of the Ionic app (the only files which we manipulated). You can run the code:
    
    ionic start myApp sidemenu
    cd myApp

You now have the base template of our Ionic app. You can then replace the generated src directory with the one provided here. 
Once you have don that, the following code will run the application in your web browser:

    ionic serve
